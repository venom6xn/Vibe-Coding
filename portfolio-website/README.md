# Amit Thakur — Personal Portfolio

Minimal, Apple-inspired personal portfolio built with HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript. Designed to present a calm, premium, and focused professional profile for Amit Thakur.

**Contents**
- `index.html` — Main site markup
- `styles.css` — Visual styling (Apple-like spacing and typography)
- `script.js` — Small interactions: smooth scroll, active nav, subtle fades
- `assets/` — Lightweight SVG visuals and placeholders

**Quick Start**

1. Open the site locally: double-click `index.html` or serve it with a simple static server.

Using Python (recommended):

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

**Customization**
- Update content in `index.html` (name, about, projects, achievements).
- Replace SVG placeholders in `assets/` with your photos or exported visuals (keep aspect ratio square for project visuals).
- Edit colors and spacing in `styles.css` via the CSS variables at the top.

**Notes**
- Fonts: the site uses the system font stack including SF Pro when available.
- Design: focuses on whitespace, premium typography, and subtle motion — avoid heavy shadows or bright colors.
